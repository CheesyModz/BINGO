# LINUX (BINGO)
Group assignment - Coded by Gary Huang, Mark Belleza, Si Yuan Yue (Ricky)

# What does this program do?
Reads input from a file that contains the RANDOM seed number and the LINUX card
Each time a key that is not 'q' or 'Q' is entered, it keeps calling a random number until theres one of the following:
5 `m` marked in a row
5 `m` marked in a column
4 `m` marked in the corners
Basically *Bingo*

# What do download?
1. LINUX.sh
2. GoodInputs file
3. (Optional) BadInputs file

# How to run - Good Inputs (To play)
For good inputs that contain correct LINUX cards and seed numbers do
`bash LINUX GoodInputs/fileName`
For example
`bash LINUX GoodInputs/badInput1`

# How to run - Bad Inputs (To test program)
For bad inputs that contain incorrect LINUX cards and seed numbers do \n
`bash LINUX BadInputs/fileName`
For example
`bash LINUX BadInputs/goodInput0`
